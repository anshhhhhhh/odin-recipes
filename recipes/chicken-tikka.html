    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Chicken tikka. Boneless tandoori chicken. Bite sized even. What’s better than that? Seriously. How can you not want to put that in your mouth?</p>
    <h3>Ingridients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>12 boneless skinless chicken thighs</li>
        <li>tandoori marinade</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine all the ingredients for the tandoori marinade in a stain proof bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut each thigh into 4 pieces. Cut each breast, if using, into 8 pieces. Combine tandoori marinade with chicken. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour and up to 12 hours.</li>
        <li>Soak skewers in water for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the lemon juice to the chicken. Mix to combine. Let stand no more than one hour.</li>
        <li>Light your grill. Build a two zone fire if using charcoal. Turn one burner to high and another to low if using gas.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from marinade. Use gloves if you have them. Tandoori marinade stains something fierce. </li>
        <li>Skewer the chicken.</li>
        <li>Grill over indirect heat until almost done – around 10-15 minutes. You want an internal temperature of about 150F for breasts or 160F for thighs at this point. You will be cooking them a bit more over direct heat. Your final target is 165F for breasts and 175F for thighs.</li>
        <li>Move chicken skewers over direct (high) heat and grill an additional 2-4 minutes, turning every minute.. You want a bit of char but you don’t want it to burn or dry out.</li>
    </ol>
